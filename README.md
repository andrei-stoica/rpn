# A minimal Reverse polish calculator

A quick test to see what I remember from my compilers class many years ago.
RPN is just backwards lisp without the brackets or state. A good reintroduction
before I try a more complicated language.

## Objectives
 - [ ] learn some Rust 
 - [ ] remember a few things about compilers (Hopefully)
 - [x] build a small tokenizer
 - [x] build a small parser
 - [ ] build a small interpreter
